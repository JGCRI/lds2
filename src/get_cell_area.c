 get_cell_area.c

 calculate the spherical earth grid cell area for all cells and store it in cell_area[NUM_CELLS] (km^2)
 
 This is the area of the surface of a sphere delineated by the lat/lon values given
 from integral r^2.cos(lat).dlat.dlon; lat from -pi/2 to pi/2, lon from 0 to 2pi
 Uses the AVE_ER earth radius defined in moirai.h
 assumes that lat and long values are valid: within +-90 and +-180
	longitude values can also be between 0 and 360
	it is really the difference that matters, so be careful at the longitude number boundary
	if area of a cell straddling +-180 is needed, shift lon inputs to maintain same dlon
 the cells should never straddle the pole (there is a check for this)
 if area of pole cap is needed, make lat1=pole, lat2=cap limit, lon1=180, lon2=-180
 the lat/lon limits can be in any order: also taken care of by the absoulte values
 
 I estimated the error with respect to spheroid earth to range from .22% (equator) to .45% (pole) of spherical value,
 with an unlikely maximum of .67% in the case where r1 and r2 are the axes of the spheroid
 This is based on spherical comparisons of area at the different radii, assuming similar curvature to the spheroid
 
 also read the cell area for the hyde data into cell_area_hyde[NUM_CELLS]
 
 arguments:
 args_struct in_args: the input file arguments
 rinfo_struct *raster_info: information about input raster data
 
 return value:
 integer error code: OK = 0, otherwise a non-zero error code
