 write_csv_float2d.c
 
 write a csv text file from a flattened 2d float array
 
 arguments:
 int out_array[]:		1d array to write to file; it is a flattened 2d array
 int d1[]:				array of numeric codes to write for the first dimension
 int d1_length:			length of dimension 1
 int d2_length:			length of dimension 2
 char *out_name:		name of output file
 args_struct in_args:	the input argument structure

 the output is organized as follows:
 each row contains the 2nd dimension values for a given 1st dimension category
 the first column is the numeric code of the 1st dimension
 
 only two decimal points are output
 
 return value:
 integer error code: OK = 0, otherwise a non-zero error code
