  read_water_footprint.c

  read a single water footprint file
  these are single band esri grid files

 water footprint files (converted to simple binary files from arc grid files by an r script):
 4320 columns, 2160 rows, 5 arcmin res
 geographic projection of wgs84
 the original data have been resampled to the full grid with upper left corner at -180, +90
 float data type
 the nodata value is -9999
 units are average annual mm for entire grid cell area (1996-2005)
 the .gri files are the binary raster data
 the .grd files are the text header info

  units are average annual mm for entire grid cell area (1996-2005)

  see Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2011:
    Mekonnen, M. M., Hoekstra, A. Y., 2011. The green, blue and grey water footprint of crops and derived crop products, Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15(5): 1577-1600.

  ARGUMENTS
      char* fname:       file name to open, with path
      float* wf_grid:    the array to load the data into; this is the full globe, and has been initialized to the file nodata value

  so read the data into the appropriate location in the grid array
  row index: (90-83)*60/5 - 1
  num columns = 4320
  1-d grid index to start at = 4320 * ((90-83)*60/5 - 1)
 
  return value:
  integer error code: OK = 0, otherwise a non-zero error code
