 read_mirca.c
 
 read one file of the mirca 2000 irragated/rainfed area into irr_grid[NUM_CELLS] and rfd_grid[NUM_CELLS]
    the stored data are in the working grid, but without unit conversion
 
 there are separate files for irrigated and rainfed data
 
 there is a file for each of 26 crops, with the files labelled with crop numbers
 
 the 5 arcmin MIRCA files
  starts at upper left corner (-180,90)
  units are hectares
  6 header lines: ncols, nrows, xllcorner (pixel corner), yllcorner (pixel corner), cellsize, NODATA_value
  file names are built from the input_MIRCA_area.txt lines
  the crop # has 1 digit for #<10, and 2 digits for #>=10
 
 also store hectares - no unit conversion
 
 arguments:
  char* fname:          file name to open, with path
  float* mirca_grid:    the array to load the data into
 
 return value:
 integer error code: OK = 0, otherwise a non-zero error code
