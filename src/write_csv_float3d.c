 write_csv_float3d.c
 
 write a csv text file from a flattened 3d float array
 
 arguments:
 int out_array[]:		1d array to write to file; it is a flattened 3d array
 int d1[]:				array of numeric codes to write for the first dimension
 int d2[]:				array of numeric codes to write for the second dimension
 int d1_length:			length of dimension 1
 int d2_length:			length of dimension 2
 int d3_length:			length of dimension 3
 char *out_name:		name of output file
 args_struct in_args:	the input argument structure

 the output is organized as follows:
	each row contains the 3rd dimension values for a given combination of the 1st and second dimensions
	the first column is the numeric code of the 1st dimension
	the second column is the numeric code of the 2nd dimension
	the second dimension varies faster than the first dimension
 
 only two decimal points are output
 
 return value:
 integer error code: OK = 0, otherwise a non-zero error code
